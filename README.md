********************************
ChatGPT is the model used: gpt-turbo-301 but the next model is super fast and is expected next month. This will reduce the response from the API from 6-7 seconds to 1-2 seconds.

# Child Safety Features
DOUBLE LAYER OF PROTECTION for child users. User enter text is sent though a moderation engine to check for any sexual, violent or other inappropriate text. Only if it passes that check will it get a response from the AI. A second level of validation is added to the AI's response which is also checked for safety content.
